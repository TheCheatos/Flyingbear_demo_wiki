# That one Flying Bear Wiki you've been looking for
This repo is created with the sole purpose of becoming your one-stop wiki if you got yourself one of Flying Bear printers.
I , the OG Cheatos, will give this repo at least an hour of work a week, trying to shape it into a proper wiki worthy of your attention.
Needless to say this is a work in progress.
